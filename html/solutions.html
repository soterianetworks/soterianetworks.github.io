    The video frames are compressed using a security key. Only the sever with the same key can reconstruct the video content.
    Compressive Sensing is especially effective with analogy signal sampling and processing. With the inherent security, it can be an effective alternative to the mainstream methods, such as H264/5.

    <h5>Anomaly Detection</h5>

    Compressive Sensing needs much less audio signals to analyze and identify problems originated from systems.

    One of the advantages of CS is that CS doesn't follow Nyquist principle - The sample rate must be more than twice the signal bandwidth in order to accurately reconstruct the signal. So, it increases the sampling efficiency significantly and reduces data analysis cost in anomaly detection.

      Our IoT operation portal implements advanced reconstruction algorithms for audio and video.

      Data processed by CS requires a reconstruction on the server side. The trade off for CS is less processing on the device and more processing on the server. Since IoT devices normaly has limited power supply and computing capacity, CS works well with IoT devices.
