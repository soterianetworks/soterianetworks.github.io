                    This equipment provides automatic quality control. It uses plug-n-play robotic arms to
                    transport parts into the measurement station where the dimensions of interest are measured.
                    The measurement data is then compared with the design specs. If the data is beyond the tolerance,
                    the corresponding part will be discarded. If the data is within the tolerance, but warrants a
                    cutting tool offset compensation, an offset is written to the CNC machine over a network connection.

                    We have partnered with Caron Engineering to create this state of the art device.
                    It combines quality assurance and CNC machine configuration capabilities. The PLC control
                    is responsible for coordinating the robotic arm, CMM device and software components
                    for image processing. The offset is calculated and written back to the CNC machines.

                    One of our customers is a manufacturer supplying small metal parts for the telecommunication industry.
                    Their operators are responsible for sampling parts on the workshop floor and recording measurement
                    data in paper forms. At the end of the day, another person will enter the data into a computer.
                    The team in the QA room conduct additional measurements and manually type data into Excel
                    sheets on computers. This data will be saved in the computer for record checking
                    purposes.

                    This practice has several problems: it's labor intensive and error prone; it doesn't prevent workers
                    from entering illegitimate data; data is delayed and not utilized for further analysis.

                    We identified a newly released bluetooth caliper on the market that can pair with a bluetooth enabled
                    computer pad device or regular computer without any other hardware or software required. This caliper is
                    even cheaper than the popular brands that require wireless adaptor and connection cables. After we
                    converted the Excel sheets/forms to web pages in the MES platform, the QA productivity improved by
                    30% instantly with realtime quality tracking capability.

                A Fortune 500 company provides monitoring and diagnostic services to hundreds of thousands of storage
                servers hosted on the customer sites. Customer security concern requires support personnel visit that
                results in high cost and slow service. A federated remote access solution is desired to allow customers
                to participate in the decision process.

                The first rollout of our solution eliminated an annual loss of 22,000 man hours,
                translating to $2M in savings. Benefits also included saved licensing costs each year.
