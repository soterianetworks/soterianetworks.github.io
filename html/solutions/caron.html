                      This is a quality control system outside the CNC machine. PLC controlled adaptors collect parts from CNC machines,
                      transfer the parts to the measurement unit; The measurement unit gathers the dimensions of the parts and sends to
                      the image processing software. The software extracts the dimensions of interest, compares them with the product
                      design file and decide if the parts are comforming to the designs. We partner with Caron Engineering and integrate
                      the compensation mechanism to adjust the CNC machine settings before defects occur.
