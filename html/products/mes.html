                  <p>The MES product by Soteria Networks is designed for customers in metal precision finishing sector.
                     There are seven major modules: MDC (Machine Data Collection), PLM
                      (Product Lifecycle Management),  Tool Management, APS (Advanced Planning & Scheduling),
                      QAM (Quality Assurance Management), and WMS (Warehouse Management System). Together they optimize
                      the resource usage, visualize the production progress and improve work efficiency.<br>
                  </p>

                  <li><b>Machine Data Collection (MDC)</b> collects machine status (down, idle, running,
                    warning, error) and part count. Real time status and overall machine OEE are used for monitoring
                    and planning purposes. Part count is used to calculate order progress and offer transparent.
                  </li>

                  <li><b>Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)</b> is a central place for product specs, drawings, G-Code
                      versioning, machine and tool requirements.
                  </li>

                  <li><b>Tool Management</b> keeps track of the cutting tool inventory and life span. </li>

                  <li><b>Advanced Planning & Scheduling (APS)</b> uses machine availability, machine tool readiness,
                      production progress, QA pass rate, and user defined events to generate work assignments automatically.
                  </li>

                  <li><b>Quality Assurance Management (QAM)</b> supported by real time QA data entry units, such as
                      bluetooth calipers and automatic CMM stations, it provides real time quality tracking at batch
                      level and supports quality issue back tracking.
                  </li>

                  <li><b>Warehouse Management System (WMS)</b> is integrated with handheld scanners and QR code printers.
                      Workers  can label and track materials, parts and finished product on the workshop floor and at storage
                      locations.
                  </li>
