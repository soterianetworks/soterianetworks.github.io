                        <li>The API Gateway provides a great infrastructure component that simplifies service oriented architect implementation.
                            APIs are registered with the API gateway. Requests for the services are routed through the API gateway.
                            The API gateway implements the authorization enforcement based on the privileges of the principal in the request.
                        </li>
                        <li>OAuth2 provides authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile phones, and living room devices.
                            It offers similar single sign on capability, but is a better choice when it comes to API level authentication for server
                            to server communication. It handles the authorization by a resource owner when a client accesses a resource server
                            protected by an OAuth2 authorization server.
                            The OAuth2 Authorization server by Soteria Networks is integrated with the SAML IDP server as its service provider,
                            thus achieving the maximum authentication service reusability.
                        </li>
                        <li>The SAML Identity Provider is an web application that creates, maintains, and manages identity information for principals
                            and provides principal authentication to other service providers within a federation, such as with web browser profiles.
                            It can also be used for non-browser profile, i.e. API authentication, although less frequently.
                        </li>
                        <li>A TOTP (Time based one-time password) is by default integrated with the SAML Identity Provider as the second authentication factor.
                            It sends a 6-digit token to the user through text or email services.
                        </li>
                        <li>The standard user and device lifecycle management is fully supported. In addition, multi-tenancy provides data segregation
                            and low maintenance for shared environment.
