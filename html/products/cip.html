                        <p>This platform has served as the foundation for multiple internal and external software products.
                           The essential components include: API Gateway, SAML Identity Server, OAuth2 Server, TOTP Server,
                           Asset Management, Organization Management, Role and Attribute Based Access Control.<br></p>

                        <li><b>API Gateway</b> is a great infrastructure component that simplifies service oriented architect
                            implementation. APIs are registered with the API gateway. Requests are routed to the desired
                            micro services through the gateway. The API gateway also implements the authorization enforcement
                            based on the privileges of the principal in the request.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>SAML Identity Provider (IDP)</b> is a web application that creates, maintains, and manages
                            identity information for principals and provides principal authentication to other service
                            providers within a federation. It is the de facto standard for enterprise.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>OAuth2 Server</b> provides authorization flows for web applications, desktop applications, mobile
                            phones, and living room devices. It offers similar single sign on capability as SAML IDP.
                            Our OAuth2 server is integrated with the SAML IDP server as its service provider; this allows
                            authentication services to be shared.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>TOTP Server</b> is a time based one-time passcode server. It is integrated with our SAML IDP
                            to support multi-factor authentication. The passcode is a 6-digit token sent to the user
                            through SMS or email.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Asset Management</b> fully supports the standard user and device lifecycle management. In addition,
                            multi-tenancy enables data segregation and offers low maintenance in a shared environment.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Organization Management</b> supports corporation level personnel management.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Role and Attribute Based Access Control</b> offers a NIST conforming implementation, it enables attribute
                            based data filtering.
                        </li>
