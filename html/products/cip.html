                        CIP is an ideal platform for application development hosted on premise or in the private cloud. It includes complete
                        multi-tenant information asset life cycle management, including business entity, organization, user, application,
                        device and API. The platform supports enterprise level single sign on (SAML & OAuth2), role based access control management,
                        attribute based access control management, and access control enforcement at API gateway level. Based on this platform,
                        we have been able to developing high quality business application, such as MES and WMS, at a fast turnaround.
