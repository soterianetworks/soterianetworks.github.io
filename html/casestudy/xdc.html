                      Smart manufacturing is the core of Industry 4.0. IoT device connectivity to the cloud offers many possibilities to improve manufacturing process. In precision finishing, in-process and post-process quality control requires part variations to be converted to CNC control offsets. 
                      
                    
                      Manual configuration and adjustment are time consuming, error prone and don't scale.

                      We are building a platform for our strategic partner XDC Industries to visualize their factory floors, automate their QA process and help them predict when a machine requires maintenance and when a test procedure needs to be executed.
